# Untitled-Berg-2-Entertainment-Project
NOTE: On our final commit to this repo, we encountered an alarming error that said our virtual environment did not exist. As a result, everything we have done does not even work.
BEFORE THIS HAPPENED:
+ We had a fully functioning player that could move in 8 directions, pick up items, etc
+ Had a working tiled map w/ collision (after an overly extended period of time trying to refresh ourselves on tiles)
+ Had the assets for enemies and powerups
