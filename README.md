# Untitled-Berg-2-Entertainment-Project
Hi everyone. Today gaming.
By Berg2 (Nick Freberg and Raina Malmberg)

Nick’s Bullet points:
Map code
    • At least 3 multilayer tiled maps. 
    • each map must be a minimum of 15x15 tiles. (this should just fit on a 1080p monitor if you are using 64x64 tiles)
    • layers can include walls and floors
    • at least one should also include an object layer
    • maps should include at least 10 unique tile types (these can be across multiple maps so 4 unique tiles on one, 5 tiles with two from the first map on the second, and then 3 new ones on the third map is fine.

Raina’s Bullet points:
Player code
    • your player needs to have some sort of statistics that they can improve and which affect their interaction with enemies and the world 
    • players need to be able to attack the enemies. 
    • one of the animations should be an attack animation
    • enemies will attack the player when the player gets within a short distance of the enemy.
    • Mouse or keyboard input as needed.


50/50 Bullet Points:
Enemy code (6 enemies, 3 per coder)
You need to have several enemies on the maps
    • the enemies should drop good stuff when defeated. 
    • There should be several types of enemies with different stats.
    • at least 8 unique sounds associated with game events.
1 Friendly NPC + 1 Quest
    • your tiled maps should include at least one with a relatively safe area 
    • in the safe area there should be a 'friendly' who will talk with the player
    • provide a 'quest' which includes dialog with a friendly other and a goal that can be accomplished on another map.
    • There must be some way of fulfilling the quest on one of the other two maps
